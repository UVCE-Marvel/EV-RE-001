## TASK 1- Build Chassis  

Use any software of your comfort to design a complete chassis of an RC car with dimensions compatible to be printed on the 3D printer available in MARVEL. The chassis should be have a calculated weight distribution depending on the application.

## Task 2 - SPI Communication  

Use any software of your comfort to design a complete chassis of an  RC car with dimensions compatible  to be printed on the 3D printer available in MARVEL. The chassis should be have a calculated weight distribution depending on the application

## Task 3 - I2C Control   

I2C combines the best features of SPI and UARTs. With I2C, you can connect multiple slaves to a single master (like SPI) and you can have multiple masters controlling single, or multiple slaves. This is really useful when you want to have more than one microcontroller logging data to a single memory card or displaying text to a single LCD.

## Task 4 - BMS  

Battery management system (BMS) is technology dedicated to the oversight of a battery pack, which is an assembly of battery cells, electrically organized in a row x column matrix configuration to enable delivery of targeted range of voltage and current for a duration of time against expected load scenarios.

## Task 6 - Make an Atmega32 - Atmega8 Master-Slave SPI Communication  

The SPI is a very simply Synchronous Peripheral Interfacing(allows devices to send and receive data at the same time) is full duplex communication. This protocol is developed by Motorola. With this interface, one Master device which initiates and controls the communication, and one or more slaves who receive and transmit to the Master.

## Task 7 - Make a Lithium-ion Battery Pack  

Make a lithium ion battery pack with 12 cells to make a BMS supply of 44.4V, 4.8Ah, 50A cont. discharge rate (BMS limiting at 60A)  

## Task 8 - Working with multiple sensors  
Use the chasis from the first task to make a fully equipped RC control car. Use any 3 sensors of your choice to provide the respective data from the sensors. Use up all of the above task to have an application in this car.

## Task 9 - EV Battery Heat Management Simulation 

Create a simple simulation using MATLAB to model the heat generation and dissipation in an electric vehicle battery during charging and discharging cycles. This project can help understand the thermal behaviour of EV batteries.
